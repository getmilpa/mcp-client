# Milpa MCP Client

> An **MCP (Model Context Protocol) client** for PHP — stdio and HTTP/SSE transports, typed tool/resource contracts, and connection management for talking to external MCP servers. `McpClientManager` connects to several servers at once and routes tool calls to the right one by a namespaced registry name.

`milpa/mcp-client` is the *outbound* half of MCP for the Milpa framework: it lets a PHP
process act as an **MCP client**, connecting to one or more external MCP servers — local
ones spawned as subprocesses (stdio) or remote ones over HTTP with Server-Sent Events —
and discovering, listing, and calling the tools and resources they expose. **No product
coupling**: its only production dependency is `guzzlehttp/guzzle`, for the HTTP/SSE
transport.

## Install

```bash
composer require milpa/mcp-client
```

## Quick example

Register a server, connect, and call one of its tools. `McpClientManager` picks the
right `TransportInterface` from the `transport` key in the config you pass it:

```php
use Milpa\McpClient\McpClientManager;

$manager = new McpClientManager();

$manager->registerServer('calculator', [
    'transport' => 'stdio',
    'command' => 'php',
    'args' => [__DIR__ . '/mcp-servers/calculator.php'],
]);

$manager->connect('calculator');
```

`connect()` runs the MCP handshake (`initialize` → `notifications/initialized`) and
discovers the server's tools and resources; every tool is indexed under a namespaced
**registry name** — `mcp_{server}_{tool}` — so a `McpClientManager` juggling several
servers never collides on a bare tool name:

```php
foreach ($manager->listAllTools() as $tool) {
    echo $tool->getRegistryName(), ' — ', $tool->description, "\n";
}
// mcp_calculator_add — Add two numbers

$result = $manager->callTool('mcp_calculator_add', ['a' => 2, 'b' => 3]);
// ['sum' => 5]

$manager->disconnectAll();
```

A remote server over HTTP/SSE looks the same, just with a different transport config:

```php
$manager->registerServer('remote-docs', [
    'transport' => 'http-sse',
    'url' => 'https://mcp.example.com/',
    'headers' => ['Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $token],
    'timeout' => 30,
]);
```

`connectAll()` connects every registered server and returns a `[name => Throwable]` map
of the ones that failed, instead of throwing on the first bad server.

## What it is

- **`McpClientManager`** — the entry point most callers use. Registers servers from
  plain config arrays, owns their `McpConnection`s, and aggregates + routes tool calls
  across all of them by registry name.
- **`McpConnection`** — one server's live session: handshake, capability discovery,
  `listTools()` / `getTool()` / `callTool()`, `listResources()` / `readResource()`, and
  `refresh()` to re-discover after the server's tool list changes.
- **`TransportInterface`** — the seam a transport implements: `connect()`,
  `disconnect()`, `isConnected()`, `request()` (JSON-RPC call, blocks for a reply), and
  `notify()` (JSON-RPC notification, no reply expected).
  - **`StdioTransport`** — spawns the server as a subprocess (`proc_open`) and speaks
    newline-delimited JSON-RPC over its stdin/stdout.
  - **`HttpSseTransport`** — POSTs JSON-RPC over Guzzle and parses the reply whether the
    server answers with a plain JSON body or a `text/event-stream` SSE payload.
- **Typed contracts** — `McpTool`, `McpResource`, and `McpCapabilities` are immutable
  value objects built with `fromArray()` from the server's raw JSON-RPC responses, not
  arrays passed around by convention.
- **A layered exception hierarchy** — every exception extends `McpException`, which
  carries the offending `serverName` for context; `McpConnectionException`,
  `McpTransportException`, `McpToolException`, and `McpServerException` (which also
  carries the JSON-RPC `errorCode` and `errorData`) narrow the failure mode.

**Be honest about scope:** this package is a client only — it does not implement or
host an MCP server. It does not persist tool schemas, cache results, or retry failed
calls; those policies belong to the host application.
